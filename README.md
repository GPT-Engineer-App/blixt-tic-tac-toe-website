# blixt-tic-tac-toe-website

Please create a website for a company or product called "Blixt". Include the following:

- A header with the Blixt logo (use a placeholder image for now)
- A hero section with a catchy slogan for Blixt (use something generic like "Blixt - Powering the Future" since we don't know the details yet) 
- An "About Blixt" section with some placeholder text
- A "Products" section with 3 placeholder product cards
- A "Contact Us" section with a contact form
- A footer with a copyright notice and links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy 
- On the side of the page, add a box that says "Tic-Tac-Toe game coming soon!"

Use a clean, modern design with an appealing color scheme. Make sure it looks polished and professional. Don't worry about the actual content yet, just focus on the overall structure and design.
